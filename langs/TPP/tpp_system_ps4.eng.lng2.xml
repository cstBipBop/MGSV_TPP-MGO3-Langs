Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium but is also freely distributable.&#xA;&#xA;The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce uncompressed GIFs.
