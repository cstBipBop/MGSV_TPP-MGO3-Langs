It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium but is also freely distributable.&#xA;&#xA;The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce uncompressed GIFs.  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.&#xA;&#xA;We are required to state that&#xA;    &quot;The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of&#xA;    CompuServe Incorporated.
